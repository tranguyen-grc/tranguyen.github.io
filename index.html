            I'm a UX/UI designer passionate about crafting seamless digital
            experiences. My journey began with a fascination for the visual
            design of video games, apps, and websites, which evolved into a deep
            interest in understanding user behavior and creating intuitive
            designs. When I'm not designing, I love drawing silly caricatures of
            my friends, listening to music, and gaming.
